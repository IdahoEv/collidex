# Collidex

Collidex is an in-development 2D geometry collision library in pure Elixir. It
supports circles, grid-aligned rectangles, and convex polygons. When comparing
two shapes, it will prefer the fastest algorithm that can test both.

For testing arbitrary convex polygons, Collidex has two available algorithms.
A fully accurate collision detector will use the Separating Axis Theorem to
check if the polygons collide.  An additional fast checker is available that
will detect most collisions and separations. In most usages it has significantly
better performance but at the cost of a few false positives in some cases of
near misses between acute polygons.

## Usage

### Points

Cartesian points are 2-tuples of the form {x, y}. I picked this format for
speed and for compatibility with [certrel/graphmath](https://hex.pm/packages/graphmath).

### Geometric primitives

Circles, Rects (grid-aligned rectangles), and Polygons are Elixir structs.
Each module has a make() function for creating them in common formats.

#### `Circle`s
Circles can be made from three arguments (center_x, center_y, radius), or a
3-tuple specifying the same values.

```
iex> Collidex.Geometry.Circle.make(0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
%Collidex.Geometry.Circle{center: {0.0, 0.0}, radius: 1.0}

iex> Collidex.Geometry.Circle.make(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
%Collidex.Geometry.Circle{center: {1.0, 1.0}, radius: 1.0}
```

#### `Rect`s

Rects are grid-aligned rectangles delineated by two opposite corners.
`Rect.make` takes a pair of vectors:

```
iex(1)> Collidex.Geometry.Rect.make({0.0, 0.0}, {1.0, 1.0})
%Collidex.Geometry.Rect{a: {0.0, 0.0}, b: {1.0, 1.0}}
```

For convenience, you may omit the braces and just specify four numbers:
```
iex(2)> Collidex.Geometry.Rect.make(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)
%Collidex.Geometry.Rect{a: {0.0, 0.0}, b: {1.0, 1.0}}
```

#### `Polygon`s

Specify polygons as an array of vectors:

```
iex(3)> Collidex.Geometry.Polygon.make([{0.0, 0.0}, {1.0, 1.0}, {2.0, 0.0}, {1.0, -1.0}])
%Collidex.Geometry.Polygon{vertices: [{0.0, 0.0}, {1.0, 1.0}, {2.0, 0.0},
  {1.0, -1.0}]}
```

### Detecting Collisions Between primitives

Pass any pair of primitives to Collidex.Detector.collision?/3. A truthy return
value indicates that they overlap on the plane. The third argument is an
optional atom representing the detection method for Polygon-to-Polygon collisions
and defaults to :accurate. For faster but less accurate comparisons, specify :fast.

### Detecting collisions between and within lists of primitives

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `collidex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:collidex, "~> 0.0.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `collidex` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:collidex]]
    end
    ```
